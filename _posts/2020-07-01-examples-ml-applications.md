## Examples of Applications

****

1. Analyzing images of products on a production line to automatically classify them:
    - Image Classification: CNN
2. Detecting tumors in brain scans
    - Semantic segmentation: CNN
3. Automatically classifying news articles
    - Natural language processing(NLP): RNN, CNN or Transformers
4. Summarizing long documents automatically
    - NLP: text summarization
5. Creating a chatbot or a personal assistant
    - NLP using natural language understanding(NLU) and question-answering modules.
6. Forecasting a company's revenue next year, based on performance metrics
    - Regression task (predicting values): Linear regression, polynomial regression model or an artificial neural network.
7. Making your app react to voice commands
    - Speech recognition requires audio samples: RNN, CNN or Transformers
8. Detecting credit card fraud
    - Anamoly detection
9. Segmenting clients based on their purchases to define marketing strategies
    - Clustering
10. Represeting a complex, high-dimensional dataset in a clear and insightful diagram
    - Data visualization, often involving dimensionality reduction techniques.
11. Recommmeding a product to a client based on past purchases.
    - Recommender system: Using neural networks.
12. Building an intelligence bot for a game
    - Reinforcement Learning.
