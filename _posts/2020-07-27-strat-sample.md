Stratified sampling, it is the method of sampling that involves the division of a 
dataset population into smaller sub-groups. I came across this while trying to solve
a simple linear regression model for price prediction.

After facing a couple of errors in my prediction values, I decided to revisit the
books and study the mathematical logics behind it and this is another quick tidbit
of mine. 

This sampling is different from a simple random sampling, where the random
selection of data is from the entire dataset and it is possible the sample is equally
likely to occur.
