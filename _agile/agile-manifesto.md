## Twelve Principles behind the Agile Manifesto

We often come across our co-workers referring to the agile manifesto for solutions to a problem faced in an agile process. The prinicples laid out in this artifact describe a culture where change is welcome and the end customer is the focus of the work. It has been a steep learning cycle for me, trying to figure out how exactly do these "principles" apply to real life scenarios. My hope here is to run through these principles and reframe them in my own words so that I can understand it more thoroughly and help me execute one of the biggest challenges I face daily in my work life - running an efficient scrum team.

We follow these principles:

__*The highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.*__
This statement speaks about two important things, one is quick result and the second being able to deliver that result continuously. A good example here can be a lemonade shop, our customer wants a quick result that is a freshly squeezed beverage to quench their thirst and the second is, when our customer returns tomorrow or a week later they expect the same quick result provided to them. 

Summary: Deliver quick and continously.

__*Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.*__
Be open to changing requirements. This is easier said than done. If we take our lemonade shop, our customer wants a cloudy freshly squeezed drink but right before we pour it into a cup and give it to them, they ask for it to be filtered or flavored.In  this instance we quickly introduce a new process step of filtering our drink before delivering to the client. This worked in a simple scenario but if we scaled it up to delivering 100 cups of the beverage, then we have a delay of delivery in our hand which is troublesome. 

Summary: Be open to changing requirements.

__*Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.*__
This is a simple one. Always deliver something that works and deliver it frequently. In our lemonade stand, our customer asks for 10 lemonades and gives us 10 mins to deliver them, which should be fairly simple, 1 cup every 60 seconds and our delivery is complete. Let's say we are able to make the first drink in half a minute and we invite our customer to taste it, we have delivered something that works, here a lemonade, to our customer. Our customer provides their input and we can leverage this new input into our lemonade making process and continue delivering, producing the beverage to our customer.

Summary: Deliver working product frequently.

__*Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.*__
Better decisions are made when the development team and the functional team work together to accomplish this goal. If we bring in a half knowlegable person who lacks skills in the business world and also is lacking skills in the technology world, they are only contributing to the delays of the delivery. I wish to not provide any examples, since this is one principle I relate to very closely, I mean daily. 

Summary: Success has a higher chance when dev and business folks are put together.

__*Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.*__
I love this one and encourage everyone to practice this prinicple in our everyday adventures. Providing a safe environment for a team to function and giving them the opportunity to work on a deliver and contribute its success confirms two important things: their self confidence and establishes trust in them. 

Summary: Support, trust and motivation.

__*The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to within a development team is face-to-face conversation.*__
Communication is key. Less e-mails or IMs and more face to face conversations. In virtual environments, this can be a task but video calls can always. I have not completely figured this out, yet.

Summary: Enable face-to-face conversations.

__*Working software is the primary measure of progress.*__
Going back to our lemonade example, our success is measured only by the delivery of the lemonade. Do I get an award for setting up an automated lemonade stand ? Or an award for an idea of setting up a lemonade stand, the success is measured on my delivery, which is a cup of lemonade.

Summary: Deliver a working software.

__*Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.*__
Okay, we delivered a lemonade quickly as the customer asked. We have a small success here. But to be succesful, we need to be able to deliver a cup of lemonade constantly with the same quality. Ofcourse, the quantity too. 

Summary: Like a marathon, keep the pace constant and continue delivering.

__*Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.*__ 
This is a challenge. Sometimes, we can have bad bunch of lemons or the squeezer is faulty. Translating this to humans, we require the right skillset if we need to deliver the product. BY having the right skillset, the design and other tech dependencies would follow through and this ensures a successful agile run.

Summary: Rights skills and technical design to costantly deliver the product.

__*Simplicity-- the art of maximizing the amount of work done - is essential.*__
K.I.S.S - keep it simple stupid.

Summary: Keep it simple.

__*The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self- organizing teams.*__
This is closely related to the previous point I just spoke about. Having the right skillset will ensure in having a good product delivery.

Summary: TBD.

__*At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.*__
Report card time. This is an activity to balance our input/output and effectively align towards adapting whatever works best to the product delivery.

Summary: Self-assessment is needed regularly.
