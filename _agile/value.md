title: "Delivering Value over Creating Value"

A common trouble I have come across project delivery teams is having a backlog that cannot be split. It's usually the latter as the resulting split would provide very little value to the user.

This is what happens when teams do not completely understand *value*.

Let's explore an example,
- A custom screen with 50 fields is needed to complete a certain task. 
- There are a couple of validations and transformation rules that need to be set up for each of them. 
- At the current time, the rules have been defined only for 10 of the fields. 

We can firmly say, the users will not accept a partial solution as it is not exactly delivering value. 

__This is a partially true statement__.

Delivering value and Creating value are completely different. Let's do a quick run, if a team does an initial implementation of the screen with just the 10 fields and this partial implementation is fully designed, coded and tested.

- Here the team has created value. There is something here that the users will value. 

The complete value will be delivered only when the new functionality is made available to the users. Using this concept, the team can probably find ways to split a big requirement. 

The logical argument still holds true, delivering value is always better than creating value, as this aligns with the definition of done.

Teams always have to focus on delivering value, but when faced with a blocker such as a complex requirement, taking this above mentioned approach can help prove a unique solution. The harsh truth is having a backlog that creates value and somewhere leads into delivering value will help the team succeed with agile.
