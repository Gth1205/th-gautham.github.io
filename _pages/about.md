I like building things. I use maths and data science on products which evolve from traditional architecture to ML/AI solutions. 

Previously, I researched and developed a Lagrangian particle tracking hypothesis using monte-carlo simulation to predict particle flow and deposition concentration on surfaces.

Currently, I live in the San Francisco Peninsula and work for a Digital Transformation Company.
