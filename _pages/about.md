I currently work as a Technology Associate, helping organizations understand their legacy quantitative information. I spend my time cleaning messy datasets, establishing data quality rules, building predicitve models and providing mathematical expertise to business users and data-focused development teams.

Previously, I researched and developed a Lagrangian particle tracking hypothesis using monte-carlo simulation to predict concentration surfaces at EMNSPC Lab between 2016 and 2018 when pursuing my Graduate degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Texas. I have experience working with Sci-kit learn, Tensorflow, Pandas, R and other data analysis and machine learning libraries.

My hobbies vary widly. Currently I train for obstacle race courses such as the Spartan Super and Beast races. I try to keep up with the weekly technological advances in the AI/GPU front. For mode details, check out my portfolio or take a look at my resume.

I currently live in the Bay Area, where I work on a number of projects for the Global Delivery Team at a Technology consulting company.
