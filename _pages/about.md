Hi! My name is Gautham Thirunavakkarasu.

I currently work as a Technology Associate, helping organizations understand their legacy quantitative information. I spend my time building models, cleaning messy datasets, establishing data quality rules and providing mathematical expertise to business users and data-focussed developer teams.

Previously, I researched and developed a Lagrangian particle tracking hypotheis using monte-carlo simulation to predict concentration surfaces at EMNSPC Lab betweeb 2016 and 2018 when pursuing my Graduate degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Texas. I have experience working with sci-kit learn, Tensorflow, pandas, R and other data analysis and machine learning libraries.

My hobbies vary widly. Currently I train for obstacle race courses such as the Spartan Super and Beast races. I try to keep up with the weekly technological advances in the AI/GPU front. For mode details, check out my portfolio or take a look at my resume.

I currently live in the Bay Area, where I work as a data scientist on a number of projects for the Global Delivery Team at Publicis Sapient.
