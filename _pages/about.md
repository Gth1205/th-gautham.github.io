I'm currently working as a Data Scientist - Associate Technology at Publicis Sapient specialized in leading project evolutions that are being transitioned from traditional architecture to solutions where machine learning and deep learning approaches are implemented. 

I spend my time cleaning messy datasets, establishing data quality rules, building predicitve models and providing mathematical expertise to business users and data-focused development teams.

Previously, I researched and developed a Lagrangian particle tracking hypothesis using monte-carlo simulation to predict concentration surfaces at EMNSPC Lab between 2016 and 2018 when pursuing my Graduate degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Texas. I have experience working with Tensorflow, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, R and other data analysis and machine learning libraries.

My hobbies vary widly. Currently I particapate in Obstacle Races and I'm training for the Beast and Sprint race courses. I try to keep up with the weekly technological advances in the AI/GPU front. For more details, take a look at my resume and reach out to me on LinkedIn.
