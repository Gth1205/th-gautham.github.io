I currently work as a Technology Associate, helping organizations understand their legacy quantitative information. I spend my time cleaning messy datasets, establishing data quality rules, building predicitve models and providing mathematical expertise to business users and data-focused development teams.

Previously, I researched and developed a Lagrangian particle tracking hypothesis using monte-carlo simulation to predict concentration surfaces at EMNSPC Lab between 2016 and 2018 when pursuing my Graduate degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Texas. I have experience working with Tensorflow, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, R and other data analysis and machine learning libraries.
