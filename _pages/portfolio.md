My interests focus on predictive analytics and its applications in bringing about digital business transformations (DBT) to help organizations understand and leverage their quantitative infomration to make definitive business decisions. After completing my thesis on predicting concentration surfaces in environmental friendly computing centers, I began working as a technology consultant with Publicis Sapient. 

Here you'll find summaries of the major projects I've done over the year, which are representative of my skills and interests. 

If you're curious about technical skills I've glossed over, feel free to contact me.
