I came across this example and article by Mike Cohn, which relates comicbook superheroes to agile and scrum. I will link the original article to this quick tidbit version. The main reason behind writing this article links to my name, *Gautham* or *GOTHAM*, the infamous city we know, where batman reigns down trouble and ensures peace and a quite night to the citizens of this great city. 

1. Batman is Humble
The scrum master (batman) lays low, divert all attention towards solutioning the problem at hand and at the end of day, the team committed to the probelm gets the recognition for its success. Batman recognizes his weakness and is always learning and improving his skills in his cave. (This is something I am learning to do.)

2. Batman protects.
He checks on the docks and the streets keeping a watchful eye for the criminal masterminds that bring evil to the city. Just like batman, the scrum master protects his team from the devious prioritization needs thrown by the product owner. The key takeway here is the team can deliver a certain function every sprint, and the focus should be in delivering what's planned in the sprint. If an important task or feature needs to be prioritized, the team should look to estimating how much of it can be done in that sprint and work towards it.


3. Batman has no special super powers.
Anyone can be batman, but not everyone is successful at it(referring to the dark knight movie series). There are no special stones or a magic fountain that gives him power, he stands as the crime solving symbol for the city. Removing impediments-that's his goal.

4. Batman never gives up.
Batman never gave up. Even when he had his back broken and thrown into the darkest dungeons, when he was defeated by Scarecrow, when he was tricked by the Joker, he always found a way back to solve the problem and save the city and its citizens. 

Have a new scope-creep, impossible deadlines, fear not. Batman is here to save the day!

5. Batman lives by a moral code.
He never kills anyone. This is what makes his character so complex and valuable to use in this reference. The scrum master would never put any one of his teammate in front of the barrel and blame them for failure(excluding other scenarios). The scrum master lives by the Agile Manifesto, establishing a sense of trust in the team and treating everyone equally and fairly.
