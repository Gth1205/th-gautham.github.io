Summary 
The air flow path and its modelling have progressed signif-icantly over the last two decades.

Role of CFD Simulation
CFD modelling is the process of representing a fluid flowproblem  by  mathematical  equations  based  on  the  fundamentallaws of physics, and solving those equations to predict the vari-ation of velocity, pressure and temperature, and other variablessuch as turbulence parameters and concentrations which are dis-ussed by Jone[10].  Eulerian or Lagrangian approaches are oneof the most popular methods for flow visualization and particletracking.   The difference in both the methods is that the Eule-rian method treats the particles as continuum and the Lagrangianmethods focuses on the particle frame of reference, treating eachparticle individually.

Simulation Methodology
The CFD solver of 6SigmaRoom is a powerful and easy touse tool with a myriad of post processing options available foraccurately simulating the flow conditions.   


Results and Conclusion

The  flow-path  and  concentration  plots  were  obtained  forthree different sizes of the contaminants.  The CFD results areobtained for transient analysis for cold-aisle and hot-aisle con-Figure 14: Concentration plot for 1μm particulate contaminant inhot-aisle containmentFigure 15: Concentration plot for 1μm particulate contaminant incold-aisle containmenttainments and were compared
